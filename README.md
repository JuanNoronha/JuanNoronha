  <b>Program Assistant | Northeastern University | Snell Engineering Centre | Boston, Massachusetts</b><br/>
  <b>Date:</b> Jan 2025 â€“ Apr 2025<br/>
  I engineered Python and Bash scripts to automate software configuration checks on 50+ lab machines, cutting manual verification time. I mentored 100+ students on Git and GitHub best practices, resulting in a 40% reduction in version control issues like merge conflicts. I also administered the engineering development environment across 50+ workstationsâ€”managing software such as MATLAB and SolidWorks and overseeing user accessâ€”to maintain 99% operational uptime.

  <b>Software Engineering Intern | JNB Sports (E-Commerce Platforms) | Mumbai, India</b><br/>
  <b>Date:</b> May 2023 â€“ Dec 2023<br/>
  I optimized the product search algorithm in C++ by implementing multithreading and advanced data structures, reducing average search latency by 30%. I automated inventory management tasks using Python and Bash on Linux, reducing manual data entry by 70% and cutting stock reconciliation errors by 25%. I collaborated with a cross-functional team to develop and deploy a checkout microservice in Java, incorporating robust error-handling and finite-state-machine logic for transaction validation to enhance reliability. I implemented comprehensive unit testing and a continuous integration pipeline to catch bugs early and accelerate release cycles. I developed a machine-learning model for personalized product recommendations by analyzing user browsing data in Python, boosting click-through rates by 15%. I also prototyped a high-performance caching layer in Rust, leveraging knowledge of computer architecture for low-level optimizations and demonstrating adaptability to new technologies.

During my undergraduate years at the University of Mumbai, I acted as a Marketing Executive and E-Leader, securing sponsorships and orchestrating TEDx-affiliated events and business-planning competitions. I also contributed as a graphic designer in the Coding Committee, promoting social-media campaigns and web layouts that elevated campus-wide engagement. Iâ€™m an avid marathonerâ€”an endeavor that sharpens my grit, focus, and love of continuous improvement.
